-- This one is as example using recursive Common Table Expression to define factorial 
-- The way I read it is , the start iis the first 'select' that sets up two attributes 'para_val' and 'fact' 
--  these are also declares as arguments or parameters in the recursion in the with part
-- the 'union all' then unions a set of selects that are generated recursively - each producing One set with one row
-- according to the values of the paramters at the previous select. 
-- the stopping point is where param_val < z.
